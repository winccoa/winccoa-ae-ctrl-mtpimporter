# WinCC OA MTP Importer

**Revolutionize Your Modular Automation with the WinCC OA MTP Importer! Transform your MTP (Module Type Package) into a fully functional WinCC OA configuration. The importer automatically creates the project structure, configures connections, and generates visualizations, reducing integration time from hours or days to minutes.**

## Overview

The MTP Importer reads the MTP file and automatically creates the WinCC OA configuration: data points, OPC UA connections, and visualization panels.

## Key Features

### Automatic data point generation

Create datapoint types and datapoints with all necessary configurations based on the MTP structure.

### Out-of-the-Box OPC UA Integration

The MTP Importer automatically sets up the required OPC UA client connections to ensure seamless data communication between your WinCC OA system and the modular units. This reduces the effort for connectivity and enables a quick start.

### Panels generation

Generate ready-to-use HMI panels. These visualizations provide immediate overview and control over your modular units.

### Contextual MTP Understanding

The importer comprehends the hierarchical structure and semantics of your MTP files. It automatically recognizes modules, interfaces, and parameters, enabling precise transfer into the WinCC OA environment and facilitating adaptation to changes.
